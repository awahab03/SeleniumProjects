Moving the project to a new location:

When moved to a different location,
Please change the path variables with new project name in the Global.java

and also in the "getFWRoot()" method at the bottom of the Global.java

To convert to Junit fw:
1. I had to break the StartFW class funcitons into separate methods to do different jobs
2. I created Junit test class to create test
3. provided script path hard coded for each test
4. I think I need to update the sel methods also to include Junit verification, so it will be captured into 
Junit test results.
